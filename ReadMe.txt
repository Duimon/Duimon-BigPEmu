Troubleshooting
---------------
If you're encountering problems with BigPEmu after a successful first use, the first thing you should try is clearing out your configuration. You can do this by deleting the BigPEmuConfig.bigpcfg in your %APPDATA%\BigPEmu folder. (this is usually somewhere like C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\BigPEmu)

If you have a different problem or your problem persists after deleting your configuration file, check the website for additional help and information.

Special thanks to everyone at Digital Eclipse, especially Mike Mika and Stephen Frost! These guys helped fund the development of this emulator, and helped make sure I'd be able to release it publicly. In the video game industry, that's a real gesture of love.

Extra special thanks to Mark Sowden (hogsy) for being a long-time supporter of my work and for becoming One Who Bares Fangs at God. May your oppressors suffer all the torments this world has to offer, my friend.

Thank you to my daughter, Alaura, for brightening my life from the moment of her birth.

Thank you to my wife and my good friends (Ruth, Kirt, Joseph, Boris, Jake) for helping me through (the remains of) my life as I suffer with cancer.
